# CODEX ( Remote Code Executor)

## Description
As the name suggests, it is a **Docker-based sandbox environment** to run a code snippet. It creates a new docker based container for each submitted code, run it in the isolated container, and return the output. It supports major programming languages C, C++,  python, java, javascript and can be extended to other language support too.<br/>
It can also be used as an **Interview platform** where interviewer can generate unique link or code. A user can enter the interview using that uniquely generated link or code. After entering the interview with a particular link, the screen will be shared in **realtime**. It means , changes in one screen will be reflected to every user's screen in that particular interview. They can also do **video call** throughout the interview.

## Tech Stack/Technologies Used
* Docker (Containerisation)
* Socket io (Realtime)
* Node.js & Express (Backend)
* Reactjs (Frontend)
* Redux (State Management)


## Concept Used:

## Thought Behind the Project:

## Setup steps:

#### Get Started
```shell
# Clone repo
git clone <repo-url>
```

> ## Server




```shell
# Go to server folder
cd rce-server

# build docker image
docker-compose build

# create volume
docker volume create my_vol

# run server in development mode
docker-compose up server
```
This will build the required docker image and run the server in a docker container which will be listening at http://localhost:3000.

#### Run in _development_ mode

Install all package dependencies (one time operation)

```shell
npm install
```

Run the application in development mode at http://localhost:3000. Should not be used in production

```shell
npm run dev
```

#### Run in _production_ mode:

Compiles the application and starts it in production production mode.

```shell
npm run compile
npm start
```

> ## Client


```shell
# Go to client folder
cd client
```

#### Run in _development_ mode

Install all package dependencies (one time operation)

```shell
npm install
```

Run the application in development mode at http://localhost:8000. 
```shell
npm start
```
